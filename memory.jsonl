The primary goal is to confirm that data chunks are received progressively over time.\n\n## 1. Tool for Manual Testing\n\nOne or more of the following tools can be used:\n\n*   **`curl`**: A command-line tool for transferring data with URLs. It's excellent for quick API interaction and observing raw responses.\n*   **Browser Developer Tools (Fetch API)**: Modern browsers' DevTools (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) allow executing JavaScript using the Fetch API directly in the console, which can handle streaming responses.\n*   **Node.js Client Script**: A simple Node.js script using a library like `node-fetch` or the built-in `http` module can be written to make the request and process the stream.\n\nFor simplicity and directness, `curl` is often a good first choice.\n\n## 2. Request Setup\n\nThe request to `server/api/admin/chat.post.ts` should be constructed as follows:\n\n*   **Method:** `POST`\n*   **URL:** `http://<YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS>/api/admin/chat` (Replace `<YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS>` with the actual host and port, e.g., `http://localhost:3000`)\n*   **Headers:**\n    *   `Content-Type: application/json`\n    *   `Authorization: Bearer <VALID_ADMIN_TOKEN>` (Replace `<VALID_ADMIN_TOKEN>` with a genuine admin authentication token)\n*   **Body:** A JSON payload designed to elicit a direct text-based streaming response from the AI.\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"message\": \"Tell me a very short story about a brave squirrel.\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n**Example `curl` command:**\n\n```bash\ncurl -N -X POST \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer <VALID_ADMIN_TOKEN>\" \\\n  -d '{\"message\": \"Tell me a very short story about a brave squirrel.\"}' \\\n  http://localhost:3000/api/admin/chat\n```\n\n## 3. Observation of Streaming\n\nThe key is to observe data arriving in chunks over time, not all at once.\n\n*   **Using `curl`:**\n    *   The `-N` (or `--no-buffer`) flag is crucial. It disables buffering of the output.\n    *   **Observation:** You should see parts of the story appearing in your terminal incrementally. For instance, the first sentence might appear, then a pause, then the next, and so on, until the full story is displayed. If the entire story appears only after a significant delay, streaming might not be working as expected.\n\n*   **Using Browser Developer Tools (Fetch API in Console):**\n    ```javascript\n    async function testStreaming() {\n      const response = await fetch('/api/admin/chat', { // Assuming same-origin or CORS configured\n        method: 'POST',\n        headers: {\n          'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n          'Authorization': 'Bearer <VALID_ADMIN_TOKEN>' // Replace with actual token\n        },\n        body: JSON.stringify({ message: \"Tell me a very short story about a brave squirrel.\" })\n      });\n\n      if (!response.ok) {\n        console.error('Request failed:', response.status, await response.text());\n        return;\n      }\n\n      if (!response.body) {\n        console.error('Response body is null. Streaming not supported or error occurred.');\n        return;\n      }\n\n      const reader = response.body.getReader();\n      const decoder = new TextDecoder();\n      let fullResponse = \"\";\n\n      console.log(\"Starting to receive stream...\");\n\n      try {\n        while (true) {\n          const { done, value } = await reader.read();\n          if (done) {\n            console.log(\"Stream finished.\");\n            break;\n          }\n          const chunk = decoder.decode(value, { stream: true });\n          console.log(\"Received chunk:\", chunk); // Observe individual chunks\n          fullResponse += chunk;\n        }\n      } catch (error) {\n        console.error(\"Error reading stream:\", error);\n      } finally {\n        reader.releaseLock();\n      }\n      console.log(\"Full streamed response:\", fullResponse);\n    }\n    // To run: paste this function into the browser console and then call testStreaming();\n    // Ensure you are on a page served from the same origin as the API, or that CORS is correctly configured.\n    ```\n    *   **Observation:** In the browser console, you will see \"Received chunk: ...\" log messages appearing one by one. Each message will contain a part of the AI's response.\n\n*   **Using a Node.js Client Script:**\n    A Node.js script would involve using a library like `node-fetch` (for Fetch API similarity) or the native `http.request`. The core logic involves:\n    1.  Making the POST request.\n    2.  Accessing `response.body` (which is a Node.js `ReadableStream`).\n    3.  Listening for `'data'` events on the stream. Each event provides a `chunk` (Buffer).\n    4.  Decoding the `chunk` (e.g., `chunk.toString('utf-8')`) and logging or processing it.\n    5.  Listening for the `'end'` event to know when the stream is complete.\n\n## 4. Expected Outcome\n\nA successful manual test of the streaming functionality is characterized by:\n\n*   **Progressive Data Reception:** Data (e.g., parts of the story) is visibly received and displayed/logged in multiple, sequential chunks over a period of time.\n*   **No Long Initial Delay for First Chunk:** The first piece of data should arrive relatively quickly, followed by subsequent pieces. A long wait followed by the entire response at once indicates a non-streaming or improperly implemented streaming behavior.\n*   **Complete and Correct Final Output:** Eventually, all chunks combined should form the complete and correct response from the AI.\n*   **Connection Remains Open During Streaming:** The HTTP connection should remain open while chunks are being transmitted and close gracefully once the stream is complete.\n\nIf these conditions are met, the streaming behavior of the endpoint can be considered manually verified.","status":"Generated"}}

This typically involves using the `fetch` API with `ReadableStream` and `TextDecoder`.\n    *   As text chunks arrive, append them to the latest AI message in the `messages` array. This should create a \"typing\" effect.\n    *   Ensure the `isSending` state is managed correctly throughout the streaming process (e.g., set to `false` only after the stream is fully consumed or an error occurs).\n2.  **Handling Non-Streamed (Tool Use) Replies:**\n    *   The frontend must still correctly handle the existing non-streamed JSON replies (e.g., `{ \"reply\": \"...\" }`) that result from backend tool use.\n    *   Differentiate between streamed and non-streamed responses. One way could be to check the `Content-Type` header of the response (e.g., `text/plain` for streams, `application/json` for tool replies).\n3.  **UI Enhancements for Professionalism:**\n    *   **Message Bubbles:** Improve the styling of message bubbles to look more modern and professional. Consider padding, border-radius, color contrast, and typography. Refer to `docs/ai/product_quality_ux.md`.\n    *   **Timestamp Display (Optional but Recommended):** Consider adding timestamps to messages (e.g., \"HH:MM\").\n    *   **Loading/Sending Indicators:** Ensure clear visual feedback when a message is being sent and when the AI is \"typing\" (i.e., streaming). The current `isSending` for the button is a good start; extend this for the message display area if appropriate.\n    *   **Error Display:** Improve how errors are displayed in the chat. Instead of just `Error: ...`, make it visually distinct and user-friendly.\n4.  **Resizable Chat Window:**\n    *   Make the main chat container (`admin-chat-container`) resizable by the user. This typically involves adding a drag handle (e.g., at the corner or edges) and using JavaScript to adjust the `width` and `height` of the container.\n    *   Ensure the chat content (messages area, input area) adapts correctly to the new size.\n    *   Persisting the size (e.g., in `localStorage`) is optional for this task but good to note for future improvement.\n5.  **Zoom/Magnify (User Request):**\n    *   The user mentioned \"放大\" (zoom/magnify). While full browser zoom is user-controlled, interpret this as a need for better readability. The resizable window and improved typography should address this. If specific font size controls are simple to add, consider it, but resizability is the primary focus for \"magnify\".\n\n**Key Files:**\n*   `components/AdminChat.vue` (Primary file to modify)\n*   `docs/ai/product_quality_ux.md` (For UI/UX guidance)\n*   `docs/ai/ecosystem_typescript.md`\n\n**Mandatory Testing Requirements (Executor Responsibility):**\n1.  **Component Tests (e.g., using Vitest with Vue Test Utils):**\n    *   Test the streaming logic: mock `fetch` to simulate streamed responses and verify messages are updated incrementally.\n    *   Test handling of non-streamed JSON replies.\n    *   Test UI changes: verify new styles are applied, resizability works (if testable in JSDOM, otherwise describe manual test).\n    *   Test error display.\n2.  **Manual Verification:**\n    *   Thoroughly test the chat UI: send messages that result in direct AI replies (streaming) and messages that trigger tool use (non-streamed JSON reply).\n    *   Verify the resizable functionality across different directions.\n    *   Check for visual regressions and ensure the UI looks professional.\n    *   Verify error messages are displayed clearly.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n1.  Modified `components/AdminChat.vue` file.\n2.  Any new or modified test files for the component.\n3.  A brief report on how testing was conducted and validated, including manual verification steps.\n\n**Constraints:**\n*   Use Vue 3 Composition API and TypeScript.\n*   Adhere to existing Tailwind CSS usage and extend it for new styles.\n*   Prioritize functionality and robustness."}}
